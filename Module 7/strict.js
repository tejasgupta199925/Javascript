'use strict'
// Tell the interpreter that we are using javascript in strict mode

a=10

console.log(a)
// Will give error that a is not defined as we defined a without any keyword and we are using javascript in strict mode
// Strict mode makes all type checking, keyword checking more strict and doesn't let us write code in indisciplinary manner
